# Assessment 
##Data Science Fellow | CZ Research + Data

Pre-work. Please provide a work sample: a Python or R script you wrote in the past for data cleaning and/or engineering. Include the file with your responses below.
Overview
Please spend no more than 2 hours on this take-home assessment. Please send a copy of this document, your responses, any code you wrote for this, and the files we ask that you create in Part 3 of this assignment in a .zip file to CZ’s Lead Data Scientist, Andrew Zaharia at andrew@campaignzero.org.

You are free to use any resources, whether they be books or internet resources, to assist you. For any sources used, please cite them where appropriate in your response. All work for this assessment must be your original work, and not include previous work you have done. If there are parts of the assessment you won’t be able to fully complete, don’t sweat it – you can write bullet points about what you’d do. We want to see how you manage and prioritize your time.

Please indicate in your response how much time you spent on each part.
A press request for Mapping Police Violence
We occasionally get press requests which require quick analyses of our data. Here is an example of a real request we got: “I am working on a story about police traffic stops. We were wondering if Mapping Police Violence happens to have data on the number of civilian deaths that occur during traffic stops each year.”

Mapping Police Violence (MPV) is a public dataset that CZ runs that tracks lives lost during police encounters in the US and compiles information around the circumstances of these incidents.
